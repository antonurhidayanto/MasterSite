# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

## Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- Vite v6+
- Running instance of `site` remote module (port 9001)

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build && npm run serve
